# solana-rebalance-bot

🌐 Available Languages: [English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This project is a custom-built grid trading and rebalancing bot designed to operate on the **Jupiter Perps LP (JLP)** and **Bitcoin (WBTC)** trading pair.
It leverages the **Jupiter Trigger API** to create, execute, and manage automated limit orders on Solana, enabling long-term accumulation strategies and systematic portfolio rebalancing.

---

## 📖 Background & Motivation
The **JLP/WBTC pair** combines yield-generating liquidity exposure (JLP) with a long-term store of value (WBTC).
This bot was designed to help long-term investors passively accumulate both assets and capture volatility in a risk-managed way.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Automated limit orders with the [Jupiter Trigger API](https://dev.jup.ag/docs/trigger-api/)
- Geometric “infinite grid” trading logic
- 50/50 value rebalancing
- Long-term accumulation strategy
- Safe execution with Jupiter’s best practices
- Modular API control (create, execute, cancel, query orders)

---

## 🚀 Vision
A robust automated trading assistant to steadily build JLP & WBTC positions with minimal manual intervention.
